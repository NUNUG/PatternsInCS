The Interpreter pattern is a little different.  It defines a recursive 
representation of text where each part of an expression is represented 
by a composite class, wherein each of the expressions subexpressions 
are represented by appropriate classes themselves until the smallest 
token can be represented in its simplest terms.

See the composite pattern example.  It's like that.

See also BNF grammar.  This is the concept behind it.  It's less of
an OOP software design pattern and more of a computer science
concept.
