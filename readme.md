# Patterns in C#

These are the C# implementations of most of the 23 patterns in the GoF Design Patterns book.  

## I do not have examples for these patterns:

 - Interpreter (because I demonstrate this a little with the Composite pattern example).
 - State
  
## I have added some extra samples
 - NoFactory - This shows you what chaotic construction of the same objects without factories will look like.

 - Simple Factory - A simpler, easier-to-understand version of an abstract factory which only produces one kind of object instead of all objects for a domain.
